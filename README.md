COMP476_Project: Mimicry
---------------------------------
A Project Developed By: Eric Davies, Sabrina D'Mello, Pierre-André Léger, Jordan Senosiain, and Jennifer Sunahara


What is Mimicry
--------------------------------
Mimicry was a hidden in plain sight multiplayer based game that pits two players against each other where one player is attempting to stop the other from completing their task. It is themed around a farm simulation, with the setting being a farm that has been invaded by a monster that is slowly killing the animals off, which the farmer is trying to stop. One player plays the part of the farmer, watching the animals behaviors and trying to distinguish the other player, disguised as a farm animal, from the animal AI. He does so through pure observation, watching the animals as they try to fufill their needs while trying to spot the animal that is not doing this at all. The mimics job is to try to behave like an animal while also trying to consume as many as possible.

Technical Components of Project
----------------------------------
Mimicry is a muliplayer game that is based around animal behaviors which can differ between animal types. The following are the main technical aspects of the project:

->Behavior Tree's and needs systems for animal behaviors.

->Dynamic character swapping for the mimic player to hide, ability to use different animals behaviors.

->Photon integration for networking the two clients together.

Work Distribution
----------------------------------
Being a group project, different members of the group worked on different components. Here is a breakdown of the work:

->Sabrina D\Mello: Player Character Objects

->Jordan Senosiain: Player Character Objects

->Pierre-André Léger: Behavior Tree Implementation, Needs system implementation, and general animal behavior tuning.

->Jennifer Sunahara: Needs System implementation, special interaction system for dog AI with player input.

->Eric Davies: Photon implementation along with Main menu development.


Example Videos of the Project
----------------------------------
The following video's were recorded in order to demo some of the functionality of the project and should give an idea of how it works:
