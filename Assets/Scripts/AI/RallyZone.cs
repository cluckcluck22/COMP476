    // TODOs
    // - Should "kick out" animals when it is full, force them to go elsewhere
    // - Define what is a "full" rallyzone
    // - Pick up animals and inject behaviors into them (maybe find a way to inject behavio trees ?)
    // - High level processing of the wander/idle behavior is handled here, this becomes the "high-level"
    //   decision making algo for those behaviors. Much like the decision node is the high-level decision making
    //   algo for the needs.
